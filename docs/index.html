      <h2>Georgian Wine</h2>
      <p>
        The whole country produces wine, and the particular grape varietals all have their specific micro-zones scattered across the national territory. However, the most well-known region for producing Georgian wine is <span>Kakheti</span>, divided into the two micro-regions of Kvareli and Telavi. Then comes Imereti, Kartli, Svaneti, Adjara, Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti, and Abkhazia.

The traditional winemaking method Georgia uses calls for egg-shaped clay jars called <a class="links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kvevri" target="_blank">qvevri</a>. This technique caught the eye of UNESCO, which has listed it as part of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
